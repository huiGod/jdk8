一.lamada
1.What is Lamada?(Wikipedia)
lambda expression in computer programming, also called anonymous function, a function (or a subroutine) defined, and possibly called, without being bound to an identifier.
Lambda expression in Lambda calculus, a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation by way of variable binding and substitution.

2.why need Lamada in java?
在java中,我们无法将函数作为参数传递给一个方法，也无法申明返回一个函数的方法。
但是这些在JavaScript中非常常见，所以JavaScript是一个非常典型的函数式语言。

Anonymous Classes:(java tutorials)
Anonymous classes enable you to make your code more concise. They enable you to declare and instantiate a class at the same time. 
They are like local classes except that they do not have a name. Use them if you need to use a local class only once.

3.FunctionalInterface(java Document)
Note that instances of functional interfaces can be created with lambda expressions, method references, or constructor references.
